# C++ Crash Course 

## C++ Background
- Created back in 1980s and it was created with two other programming languages: Simula was 1 of the two. It was slow but easy to understand.
- So it was combined with C and took the best of both worlds to form C++.
- C++ is general purpose language, not specialized for one domain but it can be used to solve a wide variety of problems 
- Examples: build browsers with C++, games, other programming languages, OS. Heavy on the CPU. C++ is so much closer to the hardware that allows it to manage CPU and memory resources efficiently.
- C++ is a `compiled language`, code that you write first has to be converted in a code that your machine can understand. This is what `compiler` is used for. 
- It is a `case sensitive language` means that it will matter if you use upper or lower case
- C++ is `statically typed` language. Means once you declare a variable,, you cannot change the type.

## Setup
- Need text editor and compiler. IDE has everything. Visual Studio -> Community version for Windows. 
- First, compile code and build using the `build` tab. 
- You can compile and run using the `debug` tab with `Start Debugging`
- To avoid the syntax bulk code that comes after running the code, add, `system("pause>0")`
- For Mac, no support for Visual Studio but install extensions for VSCode. `C/C++`, `Code Runner`. To run the code, make sure to click the `play` symbol on the top right first. TO enable input, 
* In VsCode, Go to File > Preference > Setting.
* In the User tab on the left panel, find the extensions section
* Scroll and find 'Run Code Configuration'
* Scroll and find a checkbox “Run in Terminal” (Whether to run code in Integrated Terminal) Check the box.
OR
* In your “setting.json” file, add:
"code-runner.runInTerminal": true
